Steampunkd
A Wordpress Theme highlighting antique printer's graphics

Introducing NMO Media's first available WordPress theme, Steampunkd. 

Steampunkd captures the nostalgia and quirkiness of 19th century antique printer's images, re-presenting them for your blog. This responsive theme offers one- and two-column page formats, a custom front page layout with featured post slideshow and flexible sidebar columns in the full-width templates, and a special accessorized Mystery Man for your anonymous commentors' amusement.

The theme can be downloaded now at the Steampunkd Theme Github page.

How to use:

* To activate the front page template, create a page choosing "Front Page" from the page template dropdown box. Set this page as your Static Front Page from the Settings>Reading area in the administration panel.
* To use the featured slider, create a category titled "Featured" and assigned this category to the posts you would like to be included. The slider will incorporate the featured image from each post.
* To switch to the custom anonymous gravatar, select the "Blank" option from the Settings>Discussion menu
